Obtaining FIRS Source / Compilation
-----------------------------------
Stable releases of FIRS are available via OpenTTD's built-in content service.

Nightly versions of FIRS are available from
  http://bundles.openttdcoop.org/firs/

The source of FIRS is available for releases from the DevZone's bundle server
next to the releases at
  http://bundles.openttdcoop.org/firs
The repository itself can be obtained as mercurial checkout
  hg clone http://hg.openttdcoop.org/firs

In order to compile FIRS from source you need at least a recent version of NML.
Place nmlc in your system's PATH environment variable and run the makefile:
   make                  Compile the FIRS newgrf
   make bundle_zip       Compile and create a zip with directory structure and
                         documentation
   make install          Compile, tar and install to OpenTTD data directory
                         (either guessed by the makefile or to be configured
                          in Makefile.local)

either 'make', 'make install', or 'make bundle_zip'. There's more
options, but these are probably sufficient for you to know.
